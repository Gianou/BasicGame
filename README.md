# THE BAT ADVENTURE ** an applesoft basic project
## Abstract
 

This little project is a fun way to explore and experiment BASIC and what it was like to work on an extremly limited machine.  
In this game you control a little bat that is trying  to navigate in a perilous cave filled with stalactite, stalagmite and flying monsters.
