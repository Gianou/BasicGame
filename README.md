# THE BAT ADVENTURE an applesoft basic project  
## Abstract  
 
I made this fun little project to explore and experiment programming with BASIC and what it was like to work on an extremely limited machine.  
In this game you control a little bat that is trying to navigate in a perilous cave filled with stalactite, stalagmite and flying monsters.  

## How to play  
First open the emulator https://www.calormen.com/jsbasic/  
Then go to TheBatAdventure and copy TheBatAdventure.txt file  
Paste TheBatAdventure.txt file in stead of the default "10 PRINT "Hello World"" of the emulator  
Click "Run"  
Enjoy!
